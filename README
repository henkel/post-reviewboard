Review Board
============

Review Board is a web-based tool designed to help projects and companies keep
track of pending code changes and make code reviews much less painful and
time-consuming. It is being developed for use in VMware, but is designed to be
generic enough to use in any project. It currently has support for SVN, CVS,
Perforce, Git, Bazaar, and Mercurial repositories.

Review Board is written using Django and Python.
